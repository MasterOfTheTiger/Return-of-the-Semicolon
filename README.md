# Return-of-the-Semicolon

This is a Chrome extension that adds tons of semi-colons throughout scratch.mit.edu. 


Note (added 2018-2-13): this project is pretty dumb as it simply throws a bunch of semi-colons over all of Scratch. I made this when I was starting out with content scripts with Chrome Extensions.
